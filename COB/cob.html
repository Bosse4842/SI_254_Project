          <p class="video-description">If you are not already used to the term COB, you need not worry as I will take you through how to attain such a thing. When I was in first year all of this terminology was just so overwheling. The above video does not only explain what COB is but also explains step for step how to upload quota and how to book your meals for the rest of your week. I hope you find it useful.</p>

          <p class="video-description">A good thing to know is that during the late year at around about August/September you cannot book the same way as the video above. I will take you through how to upload COB through the website using only your card. I will also take you through the process I use to upload my washing quota.</p>
